# gist-list

An easier way to see a user's GitHub gists than clicking through pages on the normal gist UI.

Try it: <https://ggorlen.github.io/gist-list>

### TODO

- Disable input and show "loading" when request is in flight
- Allow pagination for users with more than 10 pages of gists
- Improve small screen responsiveness
- Clean up code
- Fetch repos too
- Show count of gists
- Save most recent response to local storage to save API calls? (or stick to browser cache)
- Maybe run a few requests in parallel to speed up response time
- OK-looking classless CSS options:
  - Hack CSS
  - GH markdown
  - latex css
  - spcss
